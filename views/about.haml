    %h2 About

    %p How’s Business provides a view of Chicago’s local economy. It uses open data to show how several economic indicators have been trending since 2005. 

    %h2#hows-the-economy How’s the economy? 

    %p This question doesn’t have a simple, single answer. That’s because the economy is not a simple, single thing. The economy is having a job, starting a business, getting a loan, deciding to save or invest, buying a new home, or missing a mortgage payment.

    %p So if you want to know how the economy as a whole is doing, you have to find numbers that capture the economy’s many pieces.

    %p The numbers we look at

    %ul
      %li capture a key part of the economy
      %li are local
      %li are updated often
      %li have been around long enough to reveal trends
      %li are publicly accessible

    %p Let’s take them one by one.
    
    %h2#what-were-measuring What we’re measuring

    %h3#new-businesses New Business Licenses

    %p 
      New businesses 
      = succeed "." do
        %a{:href => 'http://www.kauffman.org/research-and-policy/where-will-the-jobs-come-from.aspx'} create most new jobs
      They invent new products. And they pioneer new ways of doing business. 

    %p Total businesses depend upon the balance between new businesses starting and old businesses failing. In general, higher rates of business creation increase total economic activity.

    #chart_Business-Licenses.chart

    %h4 The Data

    %p To measure new businesses, we use counts of new business licenses filed with the City of Chicago. 

    %p 
      The City of Chicago requires new companies to get business licenses
      = succeed ',' do
        %sup
          %a{:href => '#f1'} [#1]
      and reports the number and type of each business license on the City’s 
      = succeed '.' do
        %a{:href => 'https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Business-Licenses-Current-Active/uupf-x98q'} data portal 
      Each month, we add up all the licenses the City has issued to new businesses, and that is our measure.

    %p 
      Some new licenses are for existing businesses that want to do something that requires a special license. If a restaurant wants a new patio, for example, it needs an extra license. We’ve removed these kinds of licenses from our analysis
      = succeed '.' do
        %sup
          %a{:href => '#f2'} [#2]


    %h3#building-permits Building Permits (New Construction)

    %p 
      Construction makes up 4% of Chicago’s economy
      = succeed '.' do
        %sup
          %a{:href => '#f3'} [#3]
      Economists often treat new construction as a leading indicator. That means if new construction rises - or falls - you can expect the rest of the economy to follow. 
    
    #chart_Building-Permits.chart

    %h4 The Data

    %p To measure new construction, we use building permits. 

    %p 
      Real-estate developers rehabbing a building, or building a new one, must get a building permit from the City of Chicago
      = succeed '.' do
        %sup
          %a{:href => '#f4'} [#4]

    %p 
      Each month, we add up all the 
      %a{:href => 'https://data.cityofchicago.org/Buildings/Building-Permits/ydr8-5enu'} building permits
      the City has issued, and that is our measure
      = succeed '.' do
        %sup
          %a{:href => '#f5'} [#5]

    %h3#foreclosures Housing Foreclosures

    %p Foreclosures happen when a household can’t pay its bills, often because its monthly mortgage payments have gone up, or someone lost their job. The bank that issued the mortgage then takes over the home - that’s the foreclosure.

    %p So when the economy crashes, and household budgets tighten, foreclosure rates climb.

    %p But high foreclosure rates don’t just reflect a struggling economy. They also drag on the economy itself, by depressing the housing market.

    %p Here’s how it happens. Falling housing prices often spur foreclosures. Foreclosured homes, in turn, further lowering nearby housing prices. And that can lead to even more foreclosures.

    %p As the past few has shown, this negative feedback loop can depress housing prices for years, slowing the recovery of the housing market.

    #chart_Foreclosures.chart

    %h4 The Data
    
    %p 
      Our 
      %a{:href => "http://bunkum.us/hb_data/foreclosures.js"} data on foreclosure filings 
      comes from the 
      = succeed ',' do
        %a{:href => 'http://www.woodstockinst.org/'} Woodstock Institute
      a local think tank that works on housing issues. They buy it from a company called 
      = succeed ',' do
        %a{:href => 'http://www.public-record.com/content/databases/foreclosures/'} Record Information Services
      who gets it from the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County. 

    %p To avoid double counting, Woodstock removes any foreclosure filings made within 90 days of an initial filing. Then, they count up all the foreclosure filings made in Chicago for each quarter of the year.

    %h3#unemployment Unemployment

    %p For most of us, work is the economy.  

    %p If we have work, or can get it, the economy seems okay. When we start worrying about our job, or can’t find one, that what a bad economy means to us.

    %p Unemployment is a measure of how many people are out of a job and looking for work.  When unemployment is high, people suffer - and so does the economy.

    #chart_Unemployment.chart

    %h4 The Data
    
    %p Technically, the unemployment rate is the number of people who are unemployed, divided by the number of both unemployed and employed people. 

    %p It’s pretty simple to decide who counts as employed. But just because you don’t have a job doesn’t mean you count as unemployed.

    %p 
      That’s because the Bureau of Labor Statistics - the federal agency that measures unemployment - only counts you as 
      %a{:href => 'http://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm#unemployed'} officially unemployed 
      if you don’t have a job, have looked for work in the last four weeks, and are ready to start work if you get an offer. People who are not actively looking for work aren’t counted as unemployed. 

    %p 
      Our monthly unemployment rate data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
      = succeed '.' do
        %a{:href => 'http://www.bls.gov/lau/'} Local Area Unemployment Statistics
      The way they calculate this rate is 
      = succeed '.' do
        %a{:href => 'http://www.bls.gov/lau/laumthd.htm'} complicated
      We get the 
      %a{:href => 'ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/time.series/la/la.data.20.Illinois'} data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’s FTP site 
      (the series ID for Chicago unemployment is LAUPS17010003).
    
    %h2#from-raw-numbers-to-trends From raw numbers to trends

    %p Some parts of the economy rise and fall with the seasons. Construction slows down in the winter, because... its winter in Chicago.

    %p These seasonal fluctuations make it difficult to see how businesses, unemployment, and the rest are actually doing. 

    %p 
      So we try to tease out the real trends from the seasonal ups and downs. We do this with 
      = succeed ',' do
        %a{:href => 'http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/stl.html'} R
      a statistical programming language, and the 
      = succeed '.' do
        %a{:href => 'http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/stl.html'} stl package

    %p If we chose a simpler way of finding the trend, like a moving average, the overall pattern would be the same. But our approach improves the accuracy of our trend line, especially for the most recent months.

    %p We focus on how Chicago’s economy is changing, but there are other reports out there that compare our economy with those of other cities. These are useful, so let’s link to them.

        We also handle one day that is very different from the rest. In the City’s data, there are 1,994 licenses that are reported as issued on July 7, 2007. Typically, the Department of Buildings issues one to two hundred licenses on any day. We throw out the count for this day, and replace it with the average daily permits from the two week period around it.
